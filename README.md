# Flappy-Bat 🦇🍬  
> A Halloween-themed “Flappy Bird” style game where you take control of a bat and collect candy instead of coins.

## 🎮 Overview  
Flappy-Bat is a fun, lightweight 2D game built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org). The player navigates a bat through a series of vertically spaced obstacles, collecting pieces of candy for extra points. The theme is spooky-cute (think bats, candy wrappers, night sky) and is ideal for Halloween or casual arcade-style play.

## 🚀 Features  
- Physics-based “flap” mechanic: press **Space** or click to make the bat flap upward, then gravity pulls it down.  
- Endless obstacles: columns with random gaps create increasing challenge.  
- Candy collectibles: occasionally a candy appears in the gap — collect it for bonus points.  
- Score tracking: you earn 1 point per obstacle passed + 5 bonus points per candy collected.  
- Difficulty ramp: as you play, obstacle speed gradually increases.  
- Start screen, pause (press **P**), game over screen, and high‐score persistence.  
- High score stored externally (`highscore.txt`) so your best is preserved between sessions.  
- Bundled icon (`icon.ico`) for builds, so you can package into an executable easily.
